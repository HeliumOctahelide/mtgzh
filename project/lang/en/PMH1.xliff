    <source>Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
As Morophon, the Boundless enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.
Spells of the chosen type you cast cost {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} less to cast. This effect reduces only the amount of colored mana you pay.
Other creatures you control of the chosen type get +1/+1.</source>
